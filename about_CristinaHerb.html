         <!-- This paragraph describes some basic facts about me. -->
        
        <p>My name is <b>Cristina Maria Herb</b>. I was born on July 25, 2002 in Atlanta, Georgia. I moved to Delaware when I was about 2 years old and currently live in Bear, Delaware. I am half-Mexican and can  understand Spanish almost fluently. I'm currently 16 years old and just began to drive by myself a couple weeks ago. Things I like to do in my free time are running, spending time with my friends and family, and watching Netflix. My favorite color is blue, my favorite book is <i>The Hunger Games</i>, and my favorite tv shows are Grey's Anatomy and Big Brother. Finally, one of my favorite quotes is</p>
        <blockquote>"Go the extra mile it's never crowded."</blockquote>
      
         <!-- This paragraph describes my family. -->
        
        <p>I am apart of a family of four. My dad, Brad, is from Pennsylvania and is an engineer. My mom, Cony, is from Mexico, and is a nurse at Christiana Care. Finally, my brother, Miguel, is 13 years old and goes to Caravel. He plays a lot of different sports including baseball, soccer, and swimming. All my family on my moms side lives in Mexico and we try to visit about once a year. The rest of my family lives in Pennsylvania. We also have a dog named Toby. We got Toby about 2 years ago. We're not sure how old Toby is or what breed he is because he is a rescue dog. Although we do think that he is about 6 years old.</p>
        
         <!-- This paragraph describes my highschool experience. -->
        
        <p>I'm currently a Junior in high school and go to Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. Some of the classes that I'm taking are Statistics, Pre-Calc, Spanish, and Physics. I am apart of many different clubs and sports. I am on the Blue Gold Excutive Board, Student Council, and NHS. I run cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track. Overall, my favorite sport has to be Cross Country. Cross Country is during the fall and  starts on August 15. The team is made up of about 50 girls, but we are all very close. We run all over the state and even travel to farther place like, Cary, North Carolina, Manhattan, New York, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</p>
